Becoming a technical writer was never part of the plan, but it happened over time—and I’ve been enjoying it ever since. In fact, it’s not just technical writing; writing in general has always been something I enjoy and have been doing consistently for years.

In the last few years, since I took on the responsibility of managing a company’s entire product documentation, I’ve been exploring the field more deeply and putting in more effort than ever to improve.
I’ve always wanted to document my career path as well, and here we are. Hope you enjoy reading it.

Hi, I am Neelam. Tech writing just happened to me. I never knew that the IT industry even had something called “technical writing” or “content writing.” Back in my engineering days, I thought IT only meant development either developing software or building hardware. When I graduated in 2007, it was the middle of a major recession. I could not find a job in development. During that phase, I randomly applied for a role in “Content Writing and Knowledge Center” and got through. That’s how my journey began, and it is still continuing today. 

Over the years, I have seen how important documentation is for any product whether it is software, hardware  or anything in the IT world. What started as “just a job” has become something I take real pride in. I understand that while documentation might often be ignored internally by Dev Teams or Leadership but it is truly valued by the end users who depend on it.

With my experience in this journey, I have realized that documentation can never be perfect. It keeps evolving with new ideas, formats, and structures. Every project has taught me something new: a better way to explain, a simpler way to show, or a smarter way to organize information. I think that is the beauty of this domain. What matters most is keeping the user in mind and making the content easy to find and understand.

So here we are. Keep writing, keep authoring, and continue making complex products simple and accessible for everyone with your creativity.
