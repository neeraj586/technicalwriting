Becoming a technical writer was never part of the plan, but it happened over time, and I’ve been enjoying it ever since. Writing, not just technical writing, has always been something I enjoy and have done consistently for years.

In the last few years, after taking on the responsibility of managing an organisation’s entire product documentation, I started exploring the field more deeply and putting in far more effort than ever to improve.

I’ve always wanted to document my career path as well, and this website is a step in that direction. I hope you enjoy reading and find something useful along the way.

Hi, I’m Neelam. Technical writing happened to me almost by accident. During my engineering days, I never knew the IT industry even had roles called “technical writing” or “content writing.” I assumed IT meant development—either software or hardware.

I graduated in 2007, right in the middle of a major recession, and could not find a development role. During that phase, I applied for a position titled “Content Writing and Knowledge Center” without fully understanding what it involved—and that’s how my journey began. It has continued ever since.

Over the years, I’ve seen how critical documentation is for any product—software, hardware, or anything else in the IT world. What started as “just a job” gradually became something I take real pride in. While documentation may sometimes be overlooked internally by development teams or leadership, it is deeply valued by end users who depend on it.

Through this journey, I’ve learned that documentation is never truly finished. It keeps evolving with new ideas, formats, and structures. Every project teaches something new—a clearer explanation, a simpler presentation, or a smarter way to organise information. That, to me, is the beauty of this field.

So here we are. Keep writing, keep authoring, and keep making complex products simple and accessible for everyone through thoughtful documentation.
